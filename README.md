# Introduction-to-MATLAB-Projects
The following projects were created for my CSC 113 Introduction to MATLAB class that is taken by all engineers at NC State. It displays the fundamental ability
to use MATLAB in an applicable way using different methods. I have since improved a lot in MATLAB, especially in scientific computing. However, I believe
I displayed some creative measures in some of my code to get some tasks done. This also shows a broader spectrum of what I can do in MATLAB than what just my other
more engineering centric scripts can do.
