This project dealt with the challenge of iterating through lists of data that had repeats of words and properly plotting them. We weren't timed or graded for
optimization of the code, so naturally mine takes a while with the biggest word file. It also displays the skill of creating and distributing different kinds of 
files from data using MATLAB.
